# Winning-with-C-Sharp
This repository is a personal journal of my C Sharp learning process. 

Hello World! It's nice to meet you, my name is Kirimbah. I named my based on two orange cats that I used to own. One was named Kiri and the other Simbah. Unfortunately they died of sickness when they were very young. They still live with my heart and give me the strength to keep moving. 
Wow that was corny! Anyway this is a Journal. I'm going to be learning C sharp. I've completed most of the training in my new Service Desk job. My goal: To grow as a person and to be a good man to my family and friends. Someone wise once told me "personal growth and career growth should go hand in hand. Improving at both simultaneously I'll have a reason to live, grow and appreciate life. How does this translate into your career though? If you can't show enough care or respect for the people you love then you will never show the same care in your craft. I mean, you can! Just not for me. 

Alright ill stop word vomintg....

I applied to a higher paying position within my company last week. I even got an interview. Nice! After the dust settled and the air cleared, I didn't get the position. Womp womp haha! It doesn't matter, I learned alot from the interview process. There is true value in talking with others. It's the reason why humans are so advanced. Language can be used as anything, even as a tool. Coding is a language, right?

Anyway, I plan to do at least 30 minutes - 1 hour of C# studying a day. I'll upload my progress here too. Final thought: Why does everyone want to grow? What is their reason? I know mine, but it is fascinating how different everyone pushes themselves forward. Gonna go play games now! End sequence ---
